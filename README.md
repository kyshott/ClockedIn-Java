CLOCKEDIN: A surface level solution created for my Software Engineering course at WIT. Primarily utilizes the SOQL and REST API features from the Salesforce CRM platform to allow for OAuth sign in. 

*Functionality for this software is currently only working for my own self generated Salesforce org. I may create a download link later with an attached .txt file that can be updated to allow for details of users' Salesforce orgs to be inputted.

- I will eventually add a link here for my project presentation which goes over the general functionality of the software and the reason for its creation. A downloadable .msi installer or .zip file is currently not available as I, as mentioned above,
have not implemented the functionality to allow for ANY user except myself to access the org/server.
